## Running the App
An api key from The Movie DB is required to run the app. Then you can run the app by adding the following run arguments:
```
--dart-define=TMDB_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY>
```

## Test Coverage

To explore the test coverage, run tests with --coverage argument
```
flutter test --coverage
```
Then generate coverage files
```
genhtml coverage/lcov.info -o coverage/html
```
Then open the html files:
```
open coverage/html/index.html
```
